abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

abstract = "xorshift* generators are a variant of Marsaglia’s xorshift generators that eliminate linear artifacts typical of generators based on Z/2Z-linear operations using multiplication by a suitable constant. Shortly after high-dimensional xorshift* generators were introduced, Saito and Matsumoto suggested a different way to eliminate linear artifacts based on addition in Z/232Z, leading to the XSadd generator. Starting from the observation that the lower bits of XSadd are very weak, as its reverse fails several statistical tests, we explore variants of XSadd using 64-bit operations, and describe in detail xorshift128+, an extremely fast generator that passes strong statistical tests using only three shifts, four xors and an addition."
